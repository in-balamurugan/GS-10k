Our goals are to maximize\\nindividual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation,\\nreinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people\\ncontribute positively to their communities.\\nInstilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which\\ntraining plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to\\nparticipate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through\\nGoldman Sachs University. To accelerate their integration into the firm and\\nour culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they\\nstart working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and\\nnetworking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training\\nevent each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and\\ntraining on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong\\nleadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high\\nperforming, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next\\ngeneration of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees’\\nprofessional growth and support throughout their careers and as they evolve\\ninto leaders, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing\\nDirector Leadership Acceleration Initiatives.\\nEnhancing our people’s experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we\\nbelieve that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create\\ndiverse experiences to build future leaders.\\nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance\\nreview process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors,\\nand employees whom they supervise in a\\nreview process that is integral to our team approach and includes an\\nevaluation of an employee’s performance with respect to risk management,\\nprotecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and\\ndiversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee\\nperformance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that\\nfacilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as\\nleaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have\\nalso implemented “The Three Conversations at GS” through which managers\\nestablish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in\\non progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance\\nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their\\ncommunities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction.

Community TeamWorks, our signature\\nvolunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact,\\nteam-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with\\nhundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2021, our people\\nvolunteered approximately 80,000 hours of service globally through Community\\nTeamWorks, with approximately 15,000 employees partnering with approximately\\n370 nonprofit organizations on approximately 800 community projects.

Our two priorities in\\nthis area are helping clients across industries facilitate and thrive in a\\neconomy (Climate Transition) and leveraging our capabilities to advance\\neconomic empowerment (Inclusive Growth).\\nWe have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the\\ncentralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts\\nacross our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses to\\nadvance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. In 2020, we created a new\\nrole, Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our\\ninitiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities\\nacross both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Each of our segments has\\nlaunched a Sustainability Council. These councils focus on identifying key\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities for the segment,\\ndeveloping sustainability-related capabilities and delivering sustainability-\\nfocused solutions to clients in a holistic way.\\nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial and\\nnonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to\\nthe other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks\\ninto our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our\\nBoard and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities\\nCommittees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and\\nnonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight,\\nreceives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public\\nResponsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of\\nour firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us,\\nincluding with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public\\nResponsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability\\nstrategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies\\nand processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. We have\\nalso implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall\\napproach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating\\ntransactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees\\nalso receive training with respect to environmental and social risks,\\nincluding for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for\\nthese risks. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\\nand Results of Operations — Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk\\nManagement — Climate Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this\\nfor further information about our climate risk management.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate\\nTransition for our business. In February 2021, we launched our inaugural\\nsustainability bond of $800 million, which is aligned with our sustainable\\nfinance framework for future issuances and funds a range of\\nsheet sustainable finance activity. In addition, we are working with various\\nexternal groups to develop methods, metrics and frameworks for the financial\\nsector, with an aim to support greater consistency, comparability and utility\\nin approaches to measuring the financial sector’s contribution to Climate\\nTransition initiatives. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering\\nwith our clients across our businesses, including by developing new\\nsustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or\\ncoinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced\\na target to deploy $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and\\nadvisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2021, we achieved\\napproximately 40% of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate\\nTransition. In addition, we have announced our commitment to align our\\npathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030\\nfocused on three sectors — power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing — where\\nwe believe we can have the most significant impact and we see an opportunity\\nto proactively engage our clients, investors, advocacy groups and multi-\\nstakeholder organizations, deploy capital required for transition, and invest\\nin new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy.\\nCarbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our\\nsupply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and\\nbusiness travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded\\nour operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting\\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers\\non Inclusive Growth and advancing economic empowerment and financial\\nopportunity for all. We have sponsored initiatives, such as\\nLaunch With GS, our Urban Investment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small\\n. An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity\\nand inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as our clients and their\\nboards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that\\nwe have established in areas where we have identified gaps, or believe we are\\nable to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We also believe our\\nability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on\\nthe strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are\\nable to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work\\nenvironment. See “Business — Human Capital Management” for information about\\nour human capital management goals, programs and policies.\\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely\\ncompetitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other\\nentities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking),\\nmarket-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer\\nlending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as\\nthose entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives,\\nreal estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers\\nand dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers,\\ninsurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private\\nequity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial\\ntechnology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities\\nglobally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete\\nbased on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client\\nexperience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share\\nby committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer\\nreturns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular,\\ncorporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in\\ntheir loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with\\ninvestment banking and other assignments.\\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base\\nand geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the\\nglobalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a\\nresult, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations\\nand to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most\\nsignificant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial\\ninstitutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a\\nstronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services,\\nsuch as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to\\nbe less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as\\ndescribed below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be\\naffected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts\\nby our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in\\nour investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset\\nmanagement businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed\\nelectronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems,\\nhas increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for\\nelectronic trading are generally lower than those for\\ntrading. It appears that this trend toward\\ntrading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the\\ndifference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell\\nan instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to\\nbuy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making\\nbusinesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that\\ntypically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the\\ncompetitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and\\nservices. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience\\ncompetitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our\\ncompetitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we\\nenter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on\\nelectronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits\\non the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates are\\nexpected to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing.\\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client\\nexperiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our\\ncompetitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our\\nclients may prefer, or our competitors may develop technology platforms that\\nprovide a better client experience.\\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel\\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial\\nregulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that\\nlimitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other\\nregulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our\\ncompetitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions.\\nFor example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary\\ntrading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds\\ndifferentiate between U.S.-based and\\nbanking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to\\nform and invest in funds outside the U.S.\\nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title\\nVII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the\\ncounterparties to the transaction. The impact of regulatory developments on\\nour competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large\\nextent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance\\nevolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market\\npractice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described\\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified\\nemployees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and\\nwill continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and\\nmotivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees\\ncompetitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation\\npractices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of\\ncertain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the\\nFRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential\\nRegulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the\\nU.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are\\nnot subject to regulatory oversight.

The regulatory regimes\\napplicable to our operations worldwide have been, and continue to be, subject\\nto significant changes. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard\\nsetter for prudential bank regulation; however, its standards do not become\\neffective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules\\nto implement its standards. The implications of these regulations for our\\nbusinesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant\\nregulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\\nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and\\npolicy makers worldwide, as described below.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD\\nII, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial\\ninstitutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory\\nauthorities with tools and powers to\\naddress potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and\\nminimize taxpayers’ exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states\\nto grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U.\\nresolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to\\nrecapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting\\nits unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must\\nprovide that contracts governed by\\nlaw recognize those temporary stay and\\npowers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct\\nauthority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory\\nauthorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U.,\\ngroups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution\\nauthority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE’s\\nprimary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also\\nregulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.\\nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on\\nthe Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the\\nsame requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K.\\nfinancial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank\\nof England’s expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment\\nFramework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays,\\noperational continuity and funding in resolution.

The transitional\\nminimum internal MREL requirement became fully effective on January 1, 2022.\\nIn order to comply with the MREL statement of policy, we have provided the\\nBank of England the right to exercise\\ntriggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt\\ninstruments issued by GSI.

The powers of the\\nreceiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver\\nfor depository institutions under the FDIA, described below.\\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the\\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard\\nthe strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an\\nadministrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ claims (as opposed to\\nthe judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of\\nthe FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity. In addition, OLA limits the\\nability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against\\naffiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice\\nthat it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a\\n“bridge” holding company under its “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy\\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI\\nsuch as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC\\nhas broad powers, including the power:\\nTo transfer any of the IDI’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor,\\nincluding a newly formed “bridge” bank, without the approval of the depository\\nTo enforce the IDI’s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any\\nprovisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or  \\nTo repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party,\\nthe performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the\\nrepudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the\\norderly administration of the IDI.  \\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain\\nclaims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority\\nover other general unsecured claims, including deposits at\\nbranches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the “liquidation or other\\nresolution” of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or\\nnot the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the\\ndebtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated\\ndifferently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the\\ndepositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nDeposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the\\napplicable limits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments\\non IDIs.

FDICIA imposes\\nprogressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and\\ncapital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines.\\nFailure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository\\ninstitution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized\\ninstitutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as\\ndescribed in “Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC” above.\\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the\\nFRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the\\nundercapitalized status of the BHC’s depository institution subsidiaries. In\\ncertain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution\\nsubsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the\\nundercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for\\ncivil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee.\\nFurthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would\\ntake priority over the BHC’s general unsecured creditors, as described in\\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities.\\nAs a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in\\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits “proprietary trading,” but permits activities such\\nas underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an\\nextensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-\\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in,\\n“covered funds” (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us.

Covered funds include our private equity\\nfunds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and\\ncertain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered\\nfunds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of\\nthe fund’s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such\\nfunds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022 for our investments\\nin, and relationships with, certain legacy “illiquid funds” (as defined in the\\nVolcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013.

The broader range of permissible\\nactivities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in\\nsecurities and making investments in\\n(merchant banking activities).

For certain\\nsecuritization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy\\nthis requirement. Certain of our\\nsubsidiaries, including GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in\\nconnection with securitization activities.\\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\\nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is\\nsubject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is\\nthe U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In\\naddition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of\\nsecurity-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory\\norganizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures\\nexchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures,\\ncommodity options and swaps activities.\\nThe terms “swaps” and “security-based swaps” include a wide variety of\\nderivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as\\nswaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide\\nvariety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies,\\ncommodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities,\\ncredit events, loans and other financial obligations.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and\\nexecution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public\\nreporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all\\nswaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding\\nrecordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a\\nregistered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA,\\nGSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. CFTC\\nrules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject\\nto the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, became\\neffective in October 2021. The CFTC has also adopted financial reporting\\nrequirements for covered swap entities and amended existing capital rules for\\nCFTC-registered futures commission merchants to provide explicit capital\\nrequirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that\\nare not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap\\ndealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC’s capital requirements.\\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules\\nissued by the CFTC (in the case of our\\nswap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for\\nvariation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin are in\\nthe process of being phased in through September 2022, depending on certain\\nactivity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Inter-\\naffiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally\\nexempt from initial margin requirements.\\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap\\ndealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities,\\nsingle loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has\\nadopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i)\\ncapital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) record-keeping, financial\\nreporting and notification requirements; (iii) business conduct standards;\\n(iv) regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v) the application of risk\\nmitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. The\\ncompliance date for these SEC rules, as well as SEC rules addressing\\nregistration requirements and business conduct standards, was generally\\nOctober 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of our subsidiaries,\\nincluding GS&Co., registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and\\nbecame subject to the SEC’s regulations regarding security-based swaps. The\\nSEC has recently proposed additional regulations regarding security-based\\nswaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large\\npositions in security-based swaps.\\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of\\nswaps, securities-based swaps, business conduct and registration requirements.\\nThe CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain\\nregulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual\\nrecognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearing houses, and have\\napproved substituted compliance with certain\\nregulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules.\\nThe U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect\\nto substituted compliance for transactions subject to\\nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions\\noutside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market\\nInfrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have\\nestablished regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and\\nreporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared\\nderivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial\\nInstruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of\\nderivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges.\\nThe CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions in physical\\ncommodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of\\naffiliates or other parties trading under common ownership or control. Swap\\ndealers may currently claim an exemption from the position limits for the bona\\nfide hedging of swap-related risks, but this exemption will be eliminated in\\n2023. The CFTC position limits apply to futures on physical commodities and\\noptions on such futures, and these limits apply to both physically and cash\\nsettled positions. In addition, in 2023, the position limit rules will become\\napplicable to swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and\\noptions. The position limit rules initially impose limits in the spot month\\nonly (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is\\ntypically a period of several days). CFTC spot and non- spot month limits will\\ncontinue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities, and\\nmonth limits will at some point be adopted for other categories of\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and\\nmodernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA\\ncodifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for\\nfinancial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to\\npromulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing\\nof terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S.\\nDepartment of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for\\nBSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority,\\nincluding a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA\\nviolations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections.

These conditions\\ncan change suddenly and negatively.\\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our\\nbusinesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally\\ncharacterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product\\ngrowth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid\\nand efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor\\nconfidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.\\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low\\nlevels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor,\\nbusiness or consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending or borrowing\\npatterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost\\nof credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest\\nrates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates;\\nconcerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary\\npolicy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and\\nuncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory\\nchanges; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations\\nthat limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their\\ndomestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or\\nhostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber security threats or\\nattacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global\\ncommunication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other\\ngeopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other\\nscandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather\\nevents or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nThe financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets\\nhave been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant\\ndeclines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of\\nliquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about\\npandemic, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking\\nsystem, limitations on international trade, and potential or actual changes in\\ninterest rates, inflation and other market conditions, have, at times,\\nnegatively impacted the levels of client activity.\\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the\\nscope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer,\\ninvestor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has\\nin the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect\\nmany of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high\\nvolatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable\\nimpact on our market-making businesses.\\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding\\ncosts due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such\\ninstitutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial\\ninstitutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In\\naddition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted\\nas market participants and market practices and structures continue to adjust\\nto evolving regulatory frameworks.\\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by\\ndeclining asset values, particularly where we have net “long” positions,\\nreceive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post\\nMany of our businesses have net “long” positions in debt securities, loans,\\nderivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate)\\nand most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a\\nprincipal to facilitate our clients’ activities, including our exchange-based\\nmarket-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain\\npositions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our\\ncurrencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In\\naddition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our\\ninvesting and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are\\non a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and\\npromptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively “hedged” our\\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products,\\nincluding leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are\\nnot freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may\\nnot be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we\\ndo so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit\\nfrom increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant\\nvolatility in the prices of assets have in the past and may in the future\\nsubstantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets,\\nwhich may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability\\nto sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in\\nsuch positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may negatively affect our\\ncapital, liquidity or leverage ratios, increase our funding costs and\\ngenerally require us to maintain additional capital.\\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock\\nexchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing\\nsecurities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining\\nand in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for\\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients’\\nportfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also\\nreceive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments.\\nDeclines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients’\\nportfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that\\nsupports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of\\nthe assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting\\ncollateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide\\nadditional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example\\nof such a situation is a “margin call” in connection with a brokerage account.\\nTherefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that\\neither the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is\\ndecreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our\\ncosts and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving\\ncollateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of\\nbusiness done with our clients and counterparties.\\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of\\nvaluing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over\\nasset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit\\nrisk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate\\ncollateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the\\nvalue or liquidity of the collateral has in the past and may in the future,\\ndespite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for\\nadditional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying\\nobligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a\\nsingle type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been\\nand may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not\\npermitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner or\\ncaused a client or counterparty to go out of business.\\nOur market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by\\nchanges in the levels of market volatility.\\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide\\ntrading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in\\nvolatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and\\nthe level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the\\nresults of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase\\ntrading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by\\n(VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-\\nmaking activities or cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid\\nincreasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can\\nadversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing,\\nbut asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell\\nassets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those\\ncircumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize\\nlosses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility\\nincrease the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.\\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth\\nmanagement businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be\\nadversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors\\nand CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic,\\ngeopolitical or market conditions.\\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely\\naffected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain\\ngeopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely\\naffected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide\\ndeclines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory\\ntransactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and\\nour profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our\\ninvestment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large\\ntransactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past\\nand would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business.\\nSimilarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other\\nsecurities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new\\nissuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading\\nin, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers’ domestic markets have\\nin the past and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting\\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or\\neconomic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by\\ndecreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at\\nother times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result\\nin higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both.\\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as\\ndeclines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out\\nor other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net\\nrevenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management\\nbusinesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them\\nin products that generate less fee income.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the\\nfuture be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our\\ninvestment products or a client preference for products other than those which\\nwe offer or for products that generate lower fees.\\nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management\\nbusinesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance\\n(relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we\\nmanage or investment products that we design or sell, affects our ability to\\nretain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from\\nexisting clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we\\nearn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other\\ninvestment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent\\nthat our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer,\\nwe will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to\\nchanges in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset\\nclasses or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate\\nlower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average\\neffective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management\\nand wealth management businesses could be adversely affected.\\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an\\ninability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets.\\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us,\\nas most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part\\ndue to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability\\nto access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or\\nretain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or\\notherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem\\nour investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit\\noutflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March\\n2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response\\npandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable\\nto control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational\\nproblem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among\\nmarket participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing\\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks.\\nThe financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a\\nparty are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not\\nhave readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our\\ninvesting and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings\\nfrom these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets,\\nwhich could restrict liquidity for our positions.\\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally\\na liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other\\nmarket participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid\\nassets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market\\ncrisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example,\\nrecently an investment management firm with large positions with several\\nfinancial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the\\nsecurities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges\\nand other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise\\nrights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult\\nmarket conditions, which could further impair our liquidity.\\nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity may also negatively impact our\\nresults of operations and competitive position. Numerous regulations have been\\nadopted to introduce more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial\\ninstitutions. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress\\ntesting, minimum liquidity requirements, wholesale funding, limitations on the\\nissuance of short-term debt and structured notes, deductions for holdings of\\nTLAC and prohibitions on parent guarantees that are subject to certain cross-\\ndefaults. New and prospective liquidity-related regulations may overlap with,\\nand be impacted by, other regulatory changes, including rules relating to\\nminimum long-term debt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the treatment of\\nbrokered deposits and the capital, leverage and resolution and recovery\\nframeworks applicable to large financial institutions. Given the overlap and\\ncomplex interactions among these new and prospective regulations, they may\\nhave unintended cumulative effects, and their full impact will remain\\nuncertain, while regulatory reforms are being adopted and market practices\\ndevelop. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain\\nregulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past\\nlimited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or\\nother funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to\\nrespond efficiently to liquidity stress.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by\\ndisruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced\\naccess to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability\\nof credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a\\nsecured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on\\nan unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising\\ndeposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and\\nby obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking\\nentities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any\\ndisruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to\\nobtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we\\nare forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may\\nrequire us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of\\nfunding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our\\nbusinesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic\\ntransactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets\\nto finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost\\nof credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients’\\nmerger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and\\nadversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses.\\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected\\nby a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price\\ntransparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and\\nsize, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability\\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may\\nadversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit\\nratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position,\\nincrease our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or\\ntrigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and\\ncollateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties\\ncould be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post\\nadditional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing\\ncontracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by\\nrequiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash\\npayments or securities movements.\\nAs of December 2021, our counterparties could have called for additional\\ncollateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities\\nunder bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $345 million in the event\\ndowngrade of our credit ratings and $1.54 billion in the event of a\\ndowngrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency,\\ndepending on the agency’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade,\\nmay have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all\\nrating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see\\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations — Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” in\\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our\\ncredit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark\\nsecurities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can\\nsignificantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are\\ncontinuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly\\nvolatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market\\nperceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers\\nof credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for\\ncredit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has\\nlacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and\\nloans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory\\nand other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc.\\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends,\\ndistributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share\\nrepurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations,\\nincluding debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-\\ndealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend\\npayments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds\\nfrom those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to\\nrestrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to\\nminimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on\\ntheir ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts\\nto fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party\\ntransactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional\\nlimitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as\\nwell as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the\\nobligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB’s source of strength\\nrequirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such\\nsubsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede\\naccess to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations,\\nincluding debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.’s\\nright to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s\\nliquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the\\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our\\nsubsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those\\nsubsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and\\ncreditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities\\nlocated outside of the country in which such entities are located or do\\nbusiness have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to\\ntake additional steps to “ring fence” or require internal total loss-absorbing\\ncapacity (which may also be subject to\\npowers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and\\ncreditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving\\nthose entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional\\nlimitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our\\naffiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of liquidity stress,\\nthereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us\\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of\\nits subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain\\nexceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its\\nother consolidated subsidiaries on a\\nbasis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group\\nInc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their\\ncreditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity\\nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit\\nrecovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback\\nreceived from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity\\nlevels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular\\nsubsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other\\ncosts at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc.\\nguarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc.\\nResolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany\\nand external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most\\noperationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our\\nresolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such\\nlimitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory\\nrestrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or\\nmake intercompany dividends or payments.\\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\\nfor further information about regulatory restrictions.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by\\ndeterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties.\\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or\\nother assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on\\ntheir obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational\\nfailure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or\\neven concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to\\nsignificant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions,\\nwhich in turn could adversely affect us.\\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not\\nbe enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit\\nquality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a\\ndeterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure\\ntheir obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could\\nresult in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or\\notherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also\\nhave a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to\\nrequire additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial\\ndifficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled\\nto receive and the value of pledged assets.

It is possible that the application of the single point of entry\\nstrategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter\\nresolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other\\noperating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in\\ngreater losses to Group Inc.’s security holders (including holders of our\\nfixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that\\nwould result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different\\nresolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for\\nGroup Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In that case, Group Inc.’s security\\nholders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s\\nsubsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to\\noperate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition,\\nholders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.’s\\nother debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated\\ncreditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described\\nabove, to disregard the priority of creditor claims.\\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders\\nof the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are\\nexposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would\\ngenerally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private\\ncreditors, including senior creditors.\\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be\\nsatisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge\\nentity to which Group Inc.’s assets are transferred. If such a\\nexchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the\\nsecurities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or\\nany part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While\\nthe FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the\\nFDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is\\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have\\nimplemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the\\nability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or\\nconverting its unsecured debt into equity.

Group Inc.’s and Funding IHC’s obligations\\nunder the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such\\nactions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.’s liquidity.

The publication of all other LIBOR\\nsettings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December\\n31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly\\nencouraging banking organizations to cease using the USD LIBOR as a reference\\nrate in new contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest.

In addition, uncertainty\\nrelating to IBORs could result in increased capital requirements for us given\\npotential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limited\\nobservability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates\\nand operational incidents associated with changes in and the discontinuance of\\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in\\nparticular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that\\ntrigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a\\ntrigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the\\ncalculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or\\nbenchmark to be selected. As a result, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR\\nsettings, there continues to be considerable uncertainty as to how the\\nfinancial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated\\nrates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing\\nto be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in\\nclient disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our\\nIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. For LIBOR settings that ceased\\nto be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 2021,\\ndiscretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback\\nprovisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly\\nfor derivatives and other synthetic instruments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans\\nheld for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the\\nallowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized\\ncost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the\\nlevel at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine\\nthe allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured\\non a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics\\nusing a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share\\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a\\nrange of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the\\nloans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending\\ncommitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension\\noptions or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card\\nloans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic\\nscenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three\\nyears, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a\\nmodeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each\\nquarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived\\neconomic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and\\nindustry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk\\nfactors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for\\nwholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss\\ndata, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and\\nGDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the\\nborrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type.\\nIn addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include\\nratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment\\nand credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores,\\ndelinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.\\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which\\nallow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting,\\ncapture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision\\nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the\\nreporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The\\nallowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves\\nreview and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight\\nand control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and\\ncontrol functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that\\nunderlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected\\ncredit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this\\nestimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among\\nother things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual\\nresults and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the\\nallowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are\\nheld for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance\\nis determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses,\\nwhile also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding,\\nand whether such commitments are cancellable by us.\\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on\\nour allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected\\ncredit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of\\nallowance for credit losses as of December 2021 (which was primarily weighted\\ntowards the baseline economic scenario) to the expected credit losses under a\\n100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse macroeconomic model\\nassumes an emergence of new vaccine-resistant strains of\\nresulting in a resurgence of infections, an economic contraction, high\\ninflation rates in the initial quarters, gradually climbing unemployment\\nrates, decline in GDP growth rates and dislocations in the economy due to\\nshortages in the supply of some goods and services. A 100% weighting to the\\nadverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.3 billion\\nincrease in our allowance for credit losses as of December 2021. This\\nhypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential\\nadjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions\\nare inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or\\ncorrelated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic\\nenvironment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition\\nto the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the\\nallowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for\\ninvestment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and\\nassumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and\\nidentifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from\\nlitigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations),\\nand accounting for income taxes.\\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more\\nfrequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment\\nmay exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative\\nassessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that\\nthe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated\\ncarrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not\\nconclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a\\nquantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative\\nassessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires\\njudgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected\\nearnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected\\nearnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an\\nallocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount\\nof total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the\\nreporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See\\nNote 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about\\ngoodwill.

Significant judgment is required in making these\\nestimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.\\nOur total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory\\nbasis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among\\nother factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our\\nexperience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or\\ninvestigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial\\nstatements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be\\nsustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the\\ntechnical merits of the position. As of December 2021, our net liability for\\nunrecognized tax benefits was $1.16 billion. We use estimates to recognize\\ncurrent and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and\\njurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions\\nare complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers\\nand taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can\\nbe settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our\\ninterpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently\\navailable, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among\\nother factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more\\nlikely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As\\nof December 2021, we had $6.32 billion of deferred tax assets with a related\\nvaluation allowance of $895 million.

In addition, we are an active participant in\\nsecurities lending and third-party agency lending activities.

In this role, we seek\\nto earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is\\nwilling to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market\\nparticipant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer\\nspread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a\\nshort period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand,\\nand (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these\\nmarket-making activities (collectively, inventory).

For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the\\nimpact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor\\nconfidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening\\nof credit spreads on our inventory positions.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial\\nstatements for further information about our collateralized financings,\\nincluding its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and\\ninvestments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending\\nagreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions\\nin which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been\\npurchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality\\nthan unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders.\\nNonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding\\nactivities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty\\nconcentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover\\nprobabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term\\ntrades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess\\nresidual risk through our GCLA.\\nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of\\nthe assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured\\nfunding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a\\nsecured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding,\\nexcluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations,\\nis primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily\\nexecuted through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market\\nstress include certain financial instruments in the following categories:\\nmortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities,\\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities.\\nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such\\nas secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal\\nHome Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank\\nwere $100 million as of December 2021 and we had no outstanding borrowings as\\nof December 2020. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal\\nReserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our\\nliquidity planning and stress testing.\\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings.\\nA significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally\\nlong-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting\\ndate. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and\\nhybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets\\nand for other cash management purposes.

Our stress\\ntesting process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated\\nwith our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational\\nrisk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\\nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy\\nassessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately\\ncapitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress\\nscenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient\\ncapital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe\\nstress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our\\nassessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk\\nmanagement structure, governance and policy framework.\\nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios,\\nincluding our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those\\nrequired by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities\\nand risks.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary\\nto continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios\\nprovided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes\\ninto account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for\\ncapital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In\\naddition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e.,\\ndividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt\\nor other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of\\nmacroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the\\nSCB applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the\\nStandardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting\\nand minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely\\nadverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the\\nfourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a\\npercentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\\nWe submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan in April 2021 and published a summary\\nof our annual DFAST results in June 2021. See “Business — Available\\nInformation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\\nBased on our 2021 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.6% to 6.4%,\\nresulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.4% for the\\nperiod from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.

Our contingency capital plan provides a framework\\nfor analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency,\\nincluding, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital\\ndeficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the\\nappropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period,\\nincluding internal dissemination of information, as well as timely\\ncommunication with external stakeholders.\\nWe assess each of our businesses’ capital usage based on our internal\\nassessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant\\nregulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are\\nallocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into\\nconsideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital\\nconstraint is based on the results of the FRB’s annual stress test, which\\nincludes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios.\\nWe review and make any necessary adjustments to our attributed equity in\\nJanuary each year, to reflect, among other things, the results of our latest\\nCCAR process, as well as projected changes in our balance sheet. On January 1,\\n2021, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation\\nas of December 2020) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately\\n$3.7 billion for Asset Management and approximately $0.7 billion for Consumer\\n& Wealth Management, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $2.3\\nbillion for Global Markets and approximately $2.1 billion for Investment\\nBanking.

If the future effects of the pandemic were to lead to\\na sustained period of economic weakness, our businesses would be negatively\\nimpacted. This would have a negative impact on factors that are important to\\nour operating performance, such as the level of client activity,\\ncreditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our AUS.\\nWe will continue to closely monitor the rollout of vaccines across regions, as\\nwell as the impact of new variants of the virus, and will take further\\nactions, as necessary, in order to best serve the interests of our employees,\\nclients and counterparties.

Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or\\nglobal businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the\\npotential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our\\nreputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see\\n“Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for information about our\\nareas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,”\\n“Credit Risk Management,” “Operational Risk Management” and “Model Risk\\nManagement” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this\\nOverview and Structure of Risk Management\\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success.\\nAccordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that\\nemploys a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is\\ndesigned to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we\\nidentify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our\\nactivities. Our risk management structure is built around three core\\ncomponents: governance, processes and people.\\nRisk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and\\nthrough its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk\\nmanagement policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk\\nmanagement framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and\\napproval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes\\nthe levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to\\nachieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while\\nremaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our\\nstrategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and\\nproviding direction about our strategy and risk appetite.\\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity\\nrisk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk, from our\\nindependent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk\\nofficer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and\\nregulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other\\nmatters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and\\nBusiness Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The\\nchief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk\\nCommittee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio,\\nthe chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of\\nrelevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and\\nthresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management\\nprocesses are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk\\nofficer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management\\nframework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a\\nconsistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner\\nconsistent with our risk appetite.\\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital\\nManagement, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered\\nour first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-\\ngenerating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks\\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second\\nline of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of\\nthe risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate\\nin risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include\\nCompliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of\\nInternal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and\\nadministratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes\\nprofessionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including\\nrisk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently\\nassessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those\\nwithin the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the\\nAudit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line\\nrisk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line\\nand empowers independent review from the third line.\\nWe maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk\\nmanagement framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii)\\nrisk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and\\nmonitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.\\nRisk Identification and Assessment.\\nWe believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical\\nstep in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight\\ninto the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data\\ncollection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require\\nall employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk\\nidentification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is\\ndynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile\\nand business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for\\nprioritization of our most critical risks.  \\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking\\nsubstantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our\\ninventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in\\nour risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe\\nthis discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing\\nrisk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory\\nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing.\\nIt allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss\\nconcentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our\\nrisk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are\\ndesigned to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and\\nidiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but\\nnot limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and\\ncompliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined\\nscenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events\\nor conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part\\nof our capital planning and stress testing process. See “Capital Management\\nand Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information.\\nRisk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.\\nWe apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor\\nrisk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board,\\ndirectly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and\\nthresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and\\nproduct levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is\\nresponsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall\\nlimits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these\\nThe Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide,\\nbusiness and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will\\nrequire periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum\\nrisk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and\\nsecond lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid\\nmatters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance\\nCommittee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and\\nCredit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and\\ntheir subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly\\nand amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market\\nconditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.\\nEffective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to\\nget the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we\\nfocus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective\\nof ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with\\ncomplete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring\\nprocesses are designed to take into account information about both existing\\nand emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management\\nto perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into\\nrisk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide\\nmeans for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our\\nbusinesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we\\noperate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.  \\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\\nOur governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for\\non risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We\\nmake extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an\\nimportant means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and\\nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a\\nculture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines\\nof defense, committees and senior management.

We regularly reinforce our strong\\nculture of escalation and accountability across all functions.\\nEven the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed\\ndecisions in real time about the risks we are taking.

Committee membership generally consists of senior\\nmanagers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established\\nprocedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information\\nbarriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have\\ncouncils or working groups, are described below.

Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-\\nterm periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and\\nchanges for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior\\nmanagement of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk\\noversight and control functions.\\nVaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a\\ndefined time horizon with a specified confidence level.

For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of\\nour process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an\\nindependent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet\\nits financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The\\ndetermination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with\\nrespect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty’s industry, and the\\neconomic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries,\\ninspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing\\ncertain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status,\\ncollateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Potential exposure also\\ntakes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending\\ncommitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the\\nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including\\npotential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to\\ncounterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates,\\ninterest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate\\nand more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors,\\nconsistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the\\ncase of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our\\nsovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from\\npotential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit\\nmarket deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result\\nfrom the sovereign default.

We also perform firmwide stress\\ntests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about\\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct\\ntailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events\\nthat we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the\\nindirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such\\nas the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and\\ncounterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The\\nparameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress\\ntest. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to\\nunderstand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and\\nassess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.\\nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards\\nto manage the size and nature of our credit exposures.

A company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets\\nof the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the\\ncurrent period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that\\n(i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\\nor complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts\\nor disclosures to which they relate.\\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\\nAs described in Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements,\\nas of December 31, 2021, the Company carries financial instruments at fair\\nvalue, which includes $24.1 billion of financial assets and $29.2 billion of\\nfinancial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as\\none or more inputs to the financial instrument’s valuation technique are\\nsignificant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by\\nmanagement to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included\\n(i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii)\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures\\nrelating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a\\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in\\nvaluing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and\\nevaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant\\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial\\ninstruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit\\nevidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\\ncontrols relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including\\ncontrols over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the\\nvaluation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also\\nincluded, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement\\nof professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i)\\ndeveloping an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management’s\\nprocess to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing\\nthe independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of\\ndata provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management’s\\nsignificant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant\\nunobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management’s estimate to the\\nindependently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management’s process\\nincluded evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant\\nunobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used,\\nand testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to\\ndetermine the fair value of these instruments.\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nAllowance for Loan Losses — Wholesale Loan Portfolio\\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s\\nallowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio reflects\\nmanagement’s estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the\\nloans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of\\nDecember 31, 2021, $2.1 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $131.6\\nbillion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale\\nloan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio\\nis measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk\\ncharacteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans\\nthat do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes\\nqualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic\\nforecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model\\nimprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the\\nprobability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors,\\nincluding internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected\\nlife, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial\\nobligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and\\ncollateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for\\nwholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit\\nspreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term\\ninterest rates, and oil prices.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures\\nrelating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is\\na critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by\\nmanagement in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted\\nU.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor\\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\\naudit evidence related to management’s determinations, and (ii) the audit\\neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit\\nevidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\\ncontrols relating to the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale\\nloan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and\\nsignificant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing\\nmanagement’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for the\\nwholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating\\nthe appropriateness of the methodology and testing the completeness and\\naccuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The\\nprocedures also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and\\nknowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and\\nmethodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the\\nforecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for loan\\nlosses for the wholesale loan portfolio.\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1922.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nThe firm’s significant accounting policies include when and how to measure the\\nfair value of assets and liabilities, measuring the allowance for credit\\nlosses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, and\\nwhen to consolidate an entity. See Note 4 for policies on fair value\\nmeasurements, Note 9 for policies on the allowance for credit losses, and\\nbelow and Note 17 for policies on consolidation accounting. All other\\nsignificant accounting policies are either described below or included in the\\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\\nCollateralized Agreements and Financings\\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\\nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\\nTransactions with Affiliated Funds\\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\\nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial\\ninterest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest\\nin an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest\\nentity or a variable interest entity (VIE).\\nVoting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment\\nat risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities\\nindependently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the\\nactivities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic\\nperformance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right\\nto receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a\\ncontrolling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a\\nmajority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting\\ninterest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.\\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting\\ninterest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when\\nthe firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the\\npower to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE\\nor the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be\\nsignificant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.\\nWhen the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but\\ncan exert significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial\\npolicies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing\\nthe fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence\\ngenerally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or\\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new\\ninvestments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s\\nprincipal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of\\ninvolvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-\\nbenefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further\\ninformation about equity-method investments.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds\\nare typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies\\nfor which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm\\ndoes not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds\\nare usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated\\nbecause third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or\\nto remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds\\nare generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in\\ninvestments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments\\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to\\nmake certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to\\nfair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending\\ncommitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and\\nidentifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from\\nlitigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations),\\nand accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on\\nthe best available information but actual results could be materially\\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.\\nTrading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair\\nvalue either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S.\\nGAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans\\nand other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair\\nvalue option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that\\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\\nFinancial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked\\nto offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.\\nFair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other\\nprincipal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value\\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients.\\nThe firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services,\\nsuch as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing\\n(contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the\\nunderlying transaction are completed.\\nRevenues from contracts with clients represent approximately 45% of total\\nrevenues for both 2021 and 2020 (including approximately 90% of investment\\nbanking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all\\ncommissions and fees), and approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues\\nfor 2019 (including approximately 85% of investment banking revenues,\\napproximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and\\nfees).

The firm makes\\npayments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s\\ninvestment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based\\nManagement fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net\\nasset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and\\nseparately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of\\nnet asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for\\nprivate equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested\\ncapital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or\\nannually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in\\nthe period the services are provided.\\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage\\nof the management fee, the investment fund’s net asset value or the committed\\ncapital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses.\\nIncentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s or separately\\nmanaged account’s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or\\nother performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment\\nperformance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that\\nare based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment\\nprior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on\\ninvestment performance over the life of the fund, future investment\\nunderperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be\\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized\\nwhen it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur,\\nwhich is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the\\nmarket value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\\nTherefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to\\nperformance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\\nThe firm earns commissions and fees from executing and clearing client\\ntransactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as\\n(OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade\\nis executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients\\nin connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research\\ncosts incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented\\nnet within commissions and fees.\\nRemaining Performance Obligations\\nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to\\nperform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The\\nfirm’s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its\\nfinancial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities.\\nRevenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to\\nfinancial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the\\ntransaction. For the firm’s investment management activities, where fees are\\ncalculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed\\naccount, future revenues associated with such remaining performance\\nobligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in\\nthe market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed\\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management\\nfees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2021, substantially\\nall future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations\\nwill be recognized through 2029. Annual revenues associated with such\\nperformance obligations average less than $250 million through 2029.\\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has\\nrelinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial\\nassets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net\\nrevenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing\\ninvolvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair\\nvalue. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales,\\nthe assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is\\naccounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense\\nrecognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further\\ninformation about transfers of financial assets accounted for as\\ncollateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers\\nof financial assets accounted for as sales.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Cash and cash equivalents included cash and\\ndue from banks of $10.14 billion as of December 2021 and $11.95 billion as of\\nDecember 2020. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing\\ndeposits with banks of $250.90 billion as of December 2021 and $143.89 billion\\nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client\\nactivity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other\\npurposes were $24.87 billion as of December 2021 and $24.52 billion as of\\nDecember 2020. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and\\nother purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information\\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and\\ncounterparties of $103.82 billion as of December 2021 and $82.39 billion as of\\nDecember 2020, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\\norganizations of $56.85 billion as of December 2021 and $38.94 billion as of\\nDecember 2020. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans,\\nreceivables resulting from unsettled transactions and collateral posted in\\nconnection with certain derivative transactions.\\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net\\nof any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value.\\nAs these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not\\nincluded in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these\\nreceivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially\\nall would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and\\nDecember 2020. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other\\nreceivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest\\non customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the\\ntransaction and included in interest income.\\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with\\nclients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm’s right to\\nreceive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts\\nwith clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the\\npassage of time. The firm’s receivables from contracts with clients were $3.01\\nbillion as of December 2021 and $2.60 billion as of December 2020. As of both\\nDecember 2021 and December 2020 contract assets were not material.\\nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties\\nof $241.93 billion as of December 2021 and $183.57 billion as of December\\n2020, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $10.00\\nbillion as of December 2021 and $7.09 billion as of December 2020. Such\\npayables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm’s\\nprime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at\\ncost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these\\npayables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the\\nfirm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these payables been\\nincluded in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been\\nclassified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Interest on\\ncustomer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and\\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing\\ntransactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar\\narrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that\\npermit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A\\nnetting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net\\nsettlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the\\nexercise of termination rights by a\\nparty. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by\\nthe netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is\\ncalculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities\\ncollateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing\\ntransactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or\\nsimilar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable\\ncredit support agreement grants the\\nparty exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and\\napply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of\\nthe firm’s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the\\nfirm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local\\nstatutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm’s allowance for credit\\nlosses on financial assets and commitments that are measured at amortized cost\\nreflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected\\nlife of such assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial\\nassets and commitments, as well as changes to expected credit losses during\\nthe period, are recognized in earnings. These expected credit losses are\\nmeasured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that\\naffect the collectability of the reported amount.\\nThe cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under CECL as a result of\\nadopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for\\ncredit losses of $848 million. The increase in the allowance is driven by the\\nfact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full\\nexpected life of the loan portfolios and also takes into account forecasts of\\nexpected future economic conditions. In addition, in accordance with the ASU,\\nthe firm elected the fair value option for loans that were previously\\naccounted for as Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease\\nto the allowance for PCI loans of $169 million. The cumulative effect of\\nadopting this ASU was a decrease to retained earnings of $638 million (net of\\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU\\n“Reference Rate Reform — Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform\\non Financial Reporting.” This ASU provides optional relief from applying\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships\\nand other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in\\nJanuary 2021 the FASB issued ASU\\n“Reference Rate Reform — Scope,” which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating\\nto contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and\\nelected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The\\nadoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm’s\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received\\nto sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are\\nmarked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices.\\nFair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures\\ncertain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its\\nnet exposure to market and/or credit risks).\\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If\\nquoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by\\nreference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent\\ntransactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that\\nprimarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not\\nlimited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign\\nexchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e.,\\nthe spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could\\nfinance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).\\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value\\nmeasurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques\\nused to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and\\nthe lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this\\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its\\nfair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input,\\nthe firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to\\nthat input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had\\naccess at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or\\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly.\\nOne or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.\\nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial assets and\\nliabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in\\nlevels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3\\nfinancial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a\\nmarket participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as\\ncounterparty and the firm’s credit quality, funding risk, transfer\\nrestrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are\\ngenerally based on market evidence.\\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine\\nthe fair value of the firm’s financial instruments are described below. See\\nNotes 5 through 10 for further information about significant unobservable\\ninputs used to value level 3 financial instruments.\\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments,\\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most\\ngovernment obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt\\ninstruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed\\nequities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical\\nunrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets\\nfor equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in\\nabsolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument.\\nThe firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average\\ndaily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity.\\nLevel 2 instruments include certain\\ngovernment obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans\\nand securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal\\nobligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations,\\nrestricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities,\\ncommodities and certain lending commitments.\\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent\\ntrading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer\\nquotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price\\ntransparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g.,\\nindicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to\\nthe prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the\\ninstrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums\\nand liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at\\nfair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\\nLevel 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not\\nobservable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially\\nvalued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial\\nestimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to\\ndetermine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation\\ninputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable\\nevidence, including values realized on sales.\\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are\\ngenerally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques\\nand the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each\\ntype of level 3 instrument are described below:\\nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate\\nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or\\nindirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties\\nand may include tranches of varying levels of subordination.

Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are\\ngenerally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate\\ncomparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or\\nsimilar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the\\nsame or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are\\navailable. Significant inputs include:\\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or\\ncurrent levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that\\ntracks the performance of corporate credit);  \\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit\\ndefault swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the\\nunderlying reference obligation;  \\nMarket and transaction multiples for corporate debt instruments with\\nconvertibility or participation options.  \\nEquity securities consists of private equities.

Interest rate swaps and\\noptions denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are\\ncharacterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest\\nrate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the\\nshape of the yield curve (e.g.,\\nswap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable.  \\nPrice transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and\\nbaskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or\\nobligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and\\nmajor sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit\\ndefault swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit\\nrating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the\\navailability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the\\ndefault of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed\\nsecurities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price\\ntransparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more\\ncomplex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between\\ntwo or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price\\nPrices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading\\nindustrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally\\ntransparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of\\ndeveloped and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets\\ntend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors.  \\nCommodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil,\\nnatural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft\\ncommodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the\\nunderlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g.,\\ndiesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for\\ncommodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and\\ncontracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity\\nPrice transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier.\\nOptions on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity\\nindices exhibit the most price transparency.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is\\ngenerally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Share-\\nbased awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards,\\nincluding awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed\\nimmediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over\\nthe relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained\\nearnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related\\ndividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified\\nto compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-\\nbased awards. In certain cases, primarily related to conflicted employment (as\\noutlined in the applicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-\\nbased compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these\\nawards, whose terms allow for cash settlement, additional\\ncapital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the\\naward at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award.\\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and\\nRestated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of\\nRSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options,\\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based\\nawards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including\\nperformance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the\\n2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive\\nplans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was\\napproved by the firm’s shareholders.\\nAs of December 2021, 69.8 million shares were available to be delivered\\npursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock\\nunderlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under the 2018,\\n2015 or 2013 predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such\\nawards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock\\nunderlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation\\nof the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be\\ndelivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to\\nbe delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain\\nevents or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The\\n2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of\\nshareholders that occurs in 2025.\\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market\\nconditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing\\nprice of the underlying shares on the date of grant after taking into account\\na liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer\\nrestrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material\\nnon-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available\\nshortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common\\nstock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable\\naward agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is\\naccelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability\\nand, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying\\nshares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain\\nvesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not\\nsubject to performance conditions generally\\ndeliver over a three-year period.\\nthat are subject to performance or market conditions generally deliver after\\nthe end of a three to five year period.

Shares of common stock subject to the Company\\'s Shareholders\\'\\nAgreement are called \"voting shares.\" Before any of the Company\\'s shareholders\\nvote, a separate, preliminary vote is held by the persons covered by the\\nCompany\\'s Shareholders\\' Agreement. In the election of directors, all voting\\nshares will be voted in favor of the election of the director nominees\\nreceiving the highest numbers of votes cast by the covered persons in the\\npreliminary vote.

A \"business\\ncombination\" includes a merger, asset sale or a transaction resulting in a\\nfinancial benefit to the interested stockholder. An \"interested stockholder\"\\nis a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in certain\\ncases, within the preceding three years, did own) 15% or more of the\\ncorporation\\'s outstanding voting stock. Under Section 203, a business\\ncombination between the Company and an interested stockholder is prohibited\\nunless it satisfies one of the following conditions:\\nprior to the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the board of\\ndirectors of the Company must have previously approved either the business\\ncombination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an\\non consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming\\nan interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of\\nthe voting stock of the Company outstanding at the time the transaction\\ncommenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares\\noutstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested\\nstockholder), those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also\\nofficers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not\\nhave the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the\\nplan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or  \\nat or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the\\nboard of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of\\nstockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least\\n66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested\\nThe Company\\'s board of directors has adopted a resolution providing that the\\nshareholders\\' agreement will not create an \"interested stockholder.\"\\nThe Company\\'s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\\nby-laws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of encouraging\\npersons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover\\nproposals to negotiate with the Company\\'s board of directors rather than\\npursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include:\\nIn accordance with the Company\\'s restated certificate of incorporation, a\\ndirector of the Company may (but is not required to) in taking any action\\n(including an action that may involve or relate to a change or potential\\nchange in control of the Company), consider, among other things, the effects\\nthat the Company\\'s actions may have on other interests or persons (including\\nits employees, former partners of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the\\ncommunity) in addition to the Company\\'s shareholders.\\nThe Company\\'s amended and restated by-laws establish advance notice procedures\\nwith regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates\\nfor election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of\\nshareholders of the Company. These procedures provide that notice of such\\nshareholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of the\\nCompany prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. The time\\nperiods vary depending on the nature of the proposal. The notice must contain\\ncertain information specified in the amended and restated by-laws and must\\notherwise comply with the amended and restated by-laws.\\nLimitation on Ability of Shareholders to Call Special Meetings\\nThe Company\\'s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\\nby-laws provide procedures pursuant to which holders of record of not less\\nthan 25% of the voting power of outstanding shares of the Company\\'s common\\nstock may call a special meeting of shareholders. The Company\\'s amended and\\nrestated by-laws impose certain procedural requirements on shareholders\\nrequesting such a meeting (including the provision of the same information\\nrequired for shareholder proposals at annual meetings under the Company\\'s\\nadvance notice by-law provisions described above), as well as qualifications\\ndesigned to prevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings.\\nNo Written Consent of Shareholders\\nThe Company\\'s restated certificate of incorporation requires all shareholder\\nactions to be taken by a vote of the shareholders at an annual or special\\nmeeting, and does not permit the Company\\'s shareholders to act by written\\nThe Company\\'s restated certificate of incorporation provides for 150,000,000\\nauthorized shares of preferred stock. The existence of authorized but unissued\\nshares of preferred stock may enable the board of directors to render more\\ndifficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by\\nmeans of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if\\nin the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the board of directors were\\nto determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of the\\nCompany, the board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be\\nissued without shareholder approval in one or more private offerings or other\\ntransactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed\\nacquiror or insurgent shareholder or shareholder group. In this regard, the\\nrestated certificate of incorporation grants the Company\\'s board of directors\\nbroad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued\\nshares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could\\ndecrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to\\nholders of shares of common stock.

In addition, the\\nCompany will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon\\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds\\nfor such payment ( i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other\\nnon-equity claims). The Series A Preferred Stock is fully paid and\\nnonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in\\nfull and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds.\\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription\\nrights to acquire more stock of the Company.\\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for,\\nshares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the\\nCompany, except under certain limited circumstances described below under \"-\\nRegulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy.\" The Series A Preferred Stock\\nhas no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other\\nobligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series A Preferred\\nStock. The Series A Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is\\nnot a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental\\nagency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\\nDividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders\\nof Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared\\nby the Company\\'s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the\\nboard, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under\\nDelaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date,\\nquarterly in arrears on the 10th day of February, May, August and November of\\neach year (each, a \"dividend payment date\").

These dividend\\nrecord dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record\\ndate is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary\\nshares are the same as the record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock.\\nA dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to\\nbut excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series\\nA Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual\\nnumber of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends\\nwould otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment\\ndate will be the next succeeding business day unless such day falls in the\\nnext calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the\\nimmediately preceding day that is a business day.\\nFor any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on\\nthe second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such\\ndividend period in the following manner:\\nLIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S.\\ndollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on\\nMoneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second\\nLondon business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend\\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750,\\nLIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00\\nA.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the\\nfirst day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are\\noffered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in\\nthat market selected by the calculation agent: three-month deposits in U.S.\\ndollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a\\nRepresentative Amount.

The\\nCompany may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of\\nthe Series C Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series C\\nPreferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares.\\nShares of the Series C Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company\\'s common\\nstock, equally with each other series of the Company\\'s preferred stock\\noutstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other\\nseries of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior\\nseries that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the\\nSeries C Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and\\ndistributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In\\naddition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and\\ndistributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully\\navailable funds for such payment ( i.e. , after taking account of all\\nindebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series C Preferred Stock is\\nfully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their\\npurchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender\\nadditional funds.

These dividend\\nrecord dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record\\ndate is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary\\nshares are the same as the record dates for the Series C Preferred Stock.\\nA dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to\\nbut excluding the next dividend payment date.

The Series D Preferred Stock is\\npart of a single series of authorized preferred stock. The Company may from\\ntime to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series D\\nPreferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, up\\nto the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares.\\nShares of the Series D Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company\\'s common\\nstock, equally with each other series of the Company\\'s preferred stock\\noutstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other\\nseries of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior\\nseries that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the\\nSeries D Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and\\ndistributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In\\naddition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and\\ndistributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully\\navailable funds for such payment ( i.e. , after taking account of all\\nindebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series D Preferred Stock is\\nfully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their\\npurchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender\\nadditional funds.

The Series D Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is\\nnot a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental\\nagency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank.\\nDividends on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders\\nof Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared\\nby the Company\\'s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the\\nboard), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under\\nDelaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date,\\nquarterly in arrears on the 10th day of February, May, August, and November of\\neach year (each, a \"dividend payment date\").

Unless the context otherwise provides, all\\nreferences to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs\\nGroup, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries.\\nThe Company\\'s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of\\npreferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The Series J Preferred Stock is\\npart of a single series of the Company\\'s authorized preferred stock. The\\nCompany may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of\\nthe Series J Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series J\\nPreferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares.\\nShares of the Series J Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company\\'s common\\nstock, equally with each other series of the Company\\'s preferred stock\\noutstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other\\nseries of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior\\nseries that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of Series\\nJ Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions\\nof assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the\\nCompany will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon\\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds\\nfor such payment ( i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other\\nnon-equity claims). The Series J Preferred Stock is fully paid and\\nnonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in\\nfull and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds.\\nHolders of Series J Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription\\nrights to acquire more stock of the Company.\\nThe Series J Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for,\\nshares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the\\nCompany. The Series J Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not\\nsubject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or\\nrepurchase the Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock\\nrepresents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured\\nby the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or\\nDividends on shares of the Series J Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders\\nof Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared\\nby the Company\\'s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the\\nboard), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, non-\\ncumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears\\non the 10th day of February, May, August and November of each year (each, a\\n\"dividend payment date\"). These dividends accrue, with respect to each\\ndividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share\\n(equivalent to $25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to 5.50%\\nfrom the original issue date to, but excluding, May 10, 2023, and, thereafter\\nat a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.64% on the related LIBOR\\ndetermination date. In the event that the Company issues additional shares of\\nSeries J Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such\\nshares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company\\nspecifies at the time such additional shares are issued.\\nDividends will be payable to holders of record of Series J Preferred Stock as\\nthey appear on the Company\\'s books on the applicable record date, which shall\\nbe the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other\\nrecord date fixed by the Company\\'s board of directors (or a duly authorized\\ncommittee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior\\nto such dividend payment date (each, a \"dividend record date\"). These dividend\\nrecord dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record\\ndate is a business day.

Following the occurrence of an event of default,\\nthe Guarantee Trustee will exercise the same degree of care as a prudent\\nindividual would exercise in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Provided\\nthat the foregoing requirements have been met, the Guarantee Trustee is under\\nno obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Guarantees at\\nthe request of any holder of APEX, unless offered indemnity satisfactory to it\\nagainst the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.\\nThe Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking\\nrelationships with the Guarantee Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary\\nThe Guarantees are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of\\nThe Trust securities evidence beneficial interests in the Trust. A principal\\ndifference between the rights of a holder of a Trust security and a holder of\\nPreferred is that a holder of Preferred would be entitled to receive from the\\nissuer the dividends, redemption payments and payment upon liquidation in\\nrespect of Preferred while a holder of Trust securities is entitled to receive\\ndistributions from a Trust, or from the Company under a Guarantee, if and to\\nthe extent the Trust has funds available for the payment of such\\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, holders of each\\nseries of APEX will receive the distributions described under \"- Liquidation\\nDistribution upon Dissolution\" above. Upon any voluntary or involuntary\\nliquidation or bankruptcy of the Company, the holders of the Preferred would\\nbe preferred shareholders of the Company, entitled to the preferences upon\\nliquidation described under \"Description of the Preferred\" below. Since the\\nCompany is the guarantor under the Guarantee and has agreed to pay for all\\ncosts, expenses and liabilities of the Trust, other than the Trust\\'s\\nobligations to the holders of the Trust securities, the positions of a holder\\nof APEX relative to other creditors and to the Company\\'s shareholders in the\\nevent of liquidation or bankruptcy are expected to be substantially the same\\nas if that holder held the corresponding assets of the Trust directly.\\nThe following is a brief description of the terms of the Preferred held by\\nthe relevant Trust. This summary does not purport to be complete and is\\nsubject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company\\'s\\nrestated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual\\nReport of which this exhibit is a part.\\nThe Company\\'s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of\\npreferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (including the Preferred).\\nShares of the Preferred rank senior to the Company\\'s common stock, equally\\nwith each other series of the Company\\'s preferred stock outstanding as of\\nDecember 31, 2020, and at least equally with each other series of preferred\\nstock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be\\nissued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Preferred), with\\nrespect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon\\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Preferred is fully paid and\\nnonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in\\nfull and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds.\\nHolders of the Preferred do not have preemptive or subscription rights to\\nacquire more preferred stock of the Company. The Preferred is not convertible\\ninto, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or\\nother securities of the Company. The Preferred has no stated maturity and is\\nnot subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem\\nThe Preferred has a fixed liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. If the\\nCompany liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs, holders of the\\nPreferred will be entitled to receive, out of the Company\\'s assets that are\\navailable for distribution to shareholders, an amount per share equal to the\\nliquidation preference per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends,\\nwithout regard to any undeclared dividends.\\nUnless the Trust is dissolved prior to the redemption of the Preferred,\\nholders of APEX will not receive shares of the Preferred, and their interest\\nin the Preferred will be represented by their APEX. If the Trust is dissolved,\\nthe Company may elect to distribute depositary shares representing the\\nPreferred instead of fractional shares. Since the Preferred is held by the\\nProperty Trustee, holders of APEX are only able to exercise voting or other\\nrights with respect to the Preferred through the Property Trustee.\\nDividends on shares of the Preferred are not mandatory. Holders of the\\nPreferred are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company\\'s\\nboard of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of funds\\nlegally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-\\ncumulative cash dividends from the date of their issuance. These dividends are\\npayable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each, for\\npurposes of this section, a \"Dividend Payment Date\"), with respect to the\\nDividend Period, or portion thereof, ending on the day preceding the\\nrespective Dividend Payment Date, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of\\n(x) three-month LIBOR for the related distribution period plus 0.765% (in the\\ncase of the Series E Preferred Stock) or 0.77% (in the case of the Series F\\nPreferred Stock) and (y) 4.000%.\\nDividends are payable to holders of record of the Preferred as they appear on\\nthe Company\\'s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th\\ncalendar day before that Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed\\nby the Company\\'s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the\\nboard) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend\\nPayment Date (each, for purposes of this section, a \"Dividend Record Date\").\\nThese Dividend Record Dates apply regardless of whether a particular Dividend\\nA \"Dividend Period\" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date\\nto but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date. If any that would otherwise\\nbe a Dividend Payment Date is not a business day, then the next business day\\nwill be the applicable Dividend Payment Date.\\nThe amount of dividends payable per share of the Preferred on each Dividend\\nPayment Date is calculated by multiplying the per annum Dividend Rate in\\neffect for that Dividend Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\\nactual number of days in that Dividend Period and the denominator of which is\\n360, and multiplying the rate obtained by $100,000.\\nFor any Dividend Period, LIBOR shall be determined by Goldman Sachs & Co.

If the Company determines not\\nto pay any dividend or a full dividend, the Company will provide prior written\\nnotice to the Property Trustee, who will notify holders of APEX, and the\\nDividends on the Preferred are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of\\ndirectors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does\\nnot declare a dividend on the Preferred payable in respect of any Dividend\\nPeriod before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue\\nand the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend\\nPeriod on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not\\ndividends on the Preferred are declared for any future Dividend Period.\\nSo long as any share of Preferred remains outstanding, no dividend shall be\\npaid or declared on the Company\\'s common stock or any other shares of the\\nCompany\\'s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable\\nsolely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be\\npurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company,\\ndirectly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior\\nstock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one\\nshare of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than\\nthrough the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of\\njunior stock), during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividends for the\\nlatest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Preferred have\\nbeen declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment\\nthereof has been set aside).

Any such redemption will be at a\\ncash redemption price of $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid\\ndividends including, without regard to any undeclared dividends. Holders of\\nPreferred have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the\\nPreferred. If notice of redemption of any Preferred has been given and if the\\nfunds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company for the\\nbenefit of the holders of any shares of the Preferred so called for\\nredemption, then, from and after the redemption date, those shares shall no\\nlonger be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares\\n(including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the\\nright to receive the redemption price.\\nIf fewer than all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred are to be\\nredeemed, the shares to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from\\nthe holders of record of shares of the Preferred in proportion to the number\\nof shares held by those holders or by lot or in such other manner as the\\nCompany\\'s board of directors or a committee thereof may determine to be fair\\nThe Company will mail notice of every redemption of Preferred by first class\\nmail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the Preferred to\\nbe redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the Company\\'s\\nbooks.

If the Company redeems the\\nPreferred, the Trust, as holder of the Preferred, will redeem the\\ncorresponding APEX as described under \"- Mandatory Redemption of APEX upon\\nthe number of shares of the Preferred to be redeemed and, if less than all\\nshares of the Preferred held by the holder are to be redeemed, the number of\\nshares to be redeemed from the holder;  \\nthe place or places where the Preferred is to be redeemed.  \\nThe Company\\'s right to redeem the Preferred once issued is subject to prior\\napproval of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor banking agency).\\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of\\nthe Company, holders of the Preferred are entitled to receive out of assets of\\nthe Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of\\nliabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to\\nholders of common stock or of any of the Company\\'s other shares of stock\\nranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of the Preferred, a\\nliquidating distribution in the amount of $100,000 per share, plus declared\\nand unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\\nHolders of the Preferred are not entitled to any other amounts from the\\nCompany after they have received their full liquidation preference.\\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to\\npay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Preferred and\\nall holders of any other shares of the Company\\'s stock ranking equally as to\\nsuch distribution with the Preferred, the amounts paid to the holders of the\\nPreferred and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata\\nin accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those\\nholders.

The notice must be sent by the trustee or\\nthe holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the relevant series of debt\\nGSFC files for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or\\nreorganization relating to GSFC occur. Those events must arise under U.S.\\nfederal or state law, unless GSFC merges, consolidates or sells its assets as\\ndescribed above and the successor firm is a non-U.S. entity. If that happens,\\nthen those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law or the law of the\\njurisdiction in which the successor firm is legally organized; or  \\nExcept as provided by the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the debt security of that\\nseries and the related guarantee, the guarantee ceases to be effective, or a\\ncourt finds the guarantee to be unenforceable or invalid, or the Company\\ndenies its obligations as the guarantor.  \\nAs described below under \"- Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs,\" under the\\nGSFC 2008 Indenture, events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization\\nrelating to the Company will not cause any of GSFC\\'s debt securities issued\\nunder such indenture to be automatically accelerated. In the event that the\\nCompany becomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or\\nreorganization (but GSFC does not), any series of debt securities issued under\\nthe GSFC 2008 Indenture will not be immediately due and repayable. In\\naddition, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty by\\nthe Company (including, for example, a breach of the Company\\'s covenants and\\nwarranties with respect to mergers and similar transactions or restrictions on\\nliens) will not have the potential to cause any of GSFC\\'s debt securities\\nissued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture to be declared due and payable\\nimmediately. Instead, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the trustee or holder\\nwill need to wait until the earlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself becomes\\nsubject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or\\notherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities, (ii) the Company\\notherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities and (iii) the final\\nmaturity of the debt securities. The return the holder receives on any series\\nof debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture may be significantly\\nless than what a holder would have otherwise received had the debt securities\\nbeen automatically accelerated upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency\\nor reorganization relating to the Company or declared due and payable\\nimmediately following the breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company.\\nRemedies If an Event of Default Occurs\\nIf an event of default has occurred with respect to any series of debt\\nsecurities and has not been cured or waived, the trustee or the holders of not\\nless than 25% in principal amount of all debt securities of that series then\\noutstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the debt securities of\\nthat series to be due immediately. If the event of default occurs because of\\nevents in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to GSFC, the\\nentire principal amount of the debt securities of that series will be\\nautomatically accelerated, without any action by the trustee or any holder.\\nEach of the situations described above is called an acceleration of the stated\\nmaturity of the affected series of debt securities. If the stated maturity of\\nany series is accelerated and a judgment for payment has not yet been\\nobtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities\\nof that series may cancel the acceleration for the entire series.\\nIf an event of default occurs, the trustee will have special duties.

With regard to any series of debt securities, however, GSFC or the\\nCompany may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions\\nIf the successor entity in the transaction is not GSFC or the Company, as the\\ncase may be, the successor entity must be organized as a corporation,\\npartnership or trust and must expressly assume the obligations of GSFC or the\\nCompany under the debt securities of that series and the GSFC 2008 Indenture\\nwith respect to that series. The successor entity may be organized under the\\nlaws of any jurisdiction, whether in the United States or elsewhere.  \\nImmediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities of\\nthat series or the related guarantees has occurred and is continuing. For this\\npurpose, \"default under the debt securities of that series or the related\\nguarantees\" means an event of default with respect to that series or the\\nrelated guarantees or any event that would be an event of default with respect\\nto that series or the related guarantees if the requirements for giving GSFC\\nor the Company default notice and for GSFC\\'s or the Company\\'s default having\\nto continue for a specific period of time were disregarded.  \\nIf the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to debt\\nsecurities of any series, neither GSFC nor the Company will need to obtain the\\napproval of the holders of those debt securities in order to merge or\\nconsolidate or to sell assets of GSFC or the Company.

These changes are limited to clarifications and changes\\nthat would not adversely affect any debt securities of any series in any\\nmaterial respect. Neither GSFC nor the Company needs any approval to make\\nchanges that affect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable\\nindenture after the changes take effect.\\nGSFC and the Company may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not\\nadversely affect a particular debt security, even if they affect other debt\\nsecurities. In those cases, neither GSFC nor the Company needs to obtain the\\napproval of the holder of the unaffected debt security; GSFC and the Company\\nneed only obtain any required approvals from the holders of the affected debt\\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval\\nAny other change to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued\\nunder such debt indenture would require the following approval:\\nIf the change affects only particular debt securities within a series, it must\\nbe approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of such\\nIf the change affects multiple debt securities of one or more series, it must\\nbe approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt\\nsecurities affected by the change, with all such affected debt securities\\nvoting together as one class for this purpose (and by the holders of a\\nmajority in principal amount of any affected debt securities that by their\\nterms are entitled to vote separately).  \\nIn each case, the required approval must be given by written consent.\\nThis would mean that modification of terms with respect to certain debt\\nsecurities of a series could be effectuated under the GSFC 2008 Indenture\\nwithout obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount\\nof other securities of such series that are not affected by such modification.\\nThe same majority approval would be required for GSFC to obtain a waiver of\\nany of its covenants in the GSFC 2008 Indenture.

All your rights with respect to the Settlement Amount [(and any\\nDividend Equivalent Payments)] are dependent on the extent to which the\\nachieved, and any rights to delivery in respect of your Outstanding PSUs\\nimmediately will terminate and no Settlement Amount will be delivered in\\nrespect of such PSUs upon the Committee\\'s determination, in its sole\\ndiscretion, that the Performance Goal[s] [has][have] not been satisfied to the\\nextent necessary to result in delivery in respect of the PSUs.\\n(a) In General.

Until such delivery and payment, you have only the rights of a\\ngeneral unsecured creditor and you do not have any rights as a shareholder of\\nGS Inc. with respect to either the PSUs or the Settlement Amount.

If I have received any such documents and I am not the\\nintended recipient, I will disregard and destroy them.  \\nTransferability: Any provisions permitting transfers to a third party in\\nthe Award documents will not apply to me (i) to the extent that the\\napplicability of those provisions would affect the availability of relevant\\nexemptions or tax favorable treatment, or (ii) otherwise in circumstances\\ndetermined by the Firm in its sole discretion from time to time.  \\nAdequate Information: I acknowledge that (i) I have been provided with\\nall relevant information and materials with respect to the Firm\\'s operations\\nand financial conditions and the terms and conditions of my Award(s), (ii) I\\nhave read and understood such information and materials, (iii) I am fully\\naware and knowledgeable of the terms and conditions of my Award(s), and (iv) I\\ncompletely and voluntarily agree to the terms and conditions of my Award(s).  \\nIndependent Advice Recommended: The information provided by the Firm or\\nits service providers in respect of an Award does not take into account the\\nindividual circumstances of recipients and does not constitute investment\\nadvice. Awards under the SIP involve certain risks and I should exercise\\ncaution. The Firm recommends that I consult my own independent legal,\\nfinancial and tax advisors in all  \\ncases, and I acknowledge that I am provided with adequate opportunity to do\\nNo Employer Involvement: Except to the extent required by applicable\\nlaw, all Awards are offered, issued and administered by GS Inc., a Delaware\\ncorporation, and my employer (if it is not GS Inc.) is not involved in the\\ngrant of my Award(s) or any other GS Inc. equity compensation. All documents\\nrelated to the Awards, including the SIP, the Award Agreement, this Signature\\nCard and the link by which I access these documents, are originated and\\nmaintained in the United States.  \\nNo Effect on Employment-Related Rights: Any compensation I receive (even\\non a regular and repeated basis) in connection with the SIP is discretionary\\nand does not constitute part of my base or normal salary or wages. It does not\\naffect my rights and obligations under the terms of my employment and it will\\nnot be taken into account (except to the extent otherwise required by\\napplicable law) in determining any other employment-related rights I may have,\\nincluding, without limitation, rights in relation to severance, redundancy or\\nend-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement\\nbenefits. In particular, I waive any and all rights to compensation or damages\\nin consequence of the termination of my employment for any reason whatsoever\\ninsofar as those rights arise or may arise from me ceasing to have rights\\nunder, or be entitled to receive payment in respect of, the SIP as a result of\\nsuch termination, or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or\\nentitlements. This waiver applies whether or not such termination amounts to\\nwrongful or unfair dismissal.  \\nNo Additional Entitlements: The grant of an Award is strictly\\ndiscretionary and voluntary and neither this Award (even if Award grants are\\nmade to me on a regular and repeated basis) nor my employment contract implies\\nany expectation or right in relation to (i) the grant of any Award or similar\\ncompensation in the future, (ii) the terms, conditions and amount of any Award\\nor similar compensation that the Firm may decide to grant in the future, or\\n(iii) continued employment in connection with any Award.  \\nTranslations: The official Award documents (including contracts and\\ncommunications) are in the English language. I am responsible for ensuring\\nthat I fully understand these documents. The English version of the documents\\nwill always prevail in the event of any inconsistency with translated or\\nSeverability: If any provision (in whole or in part) of this Signature\\nCard or the other Award documents is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid,\\nor incapable of being enforced, that provision will be excluded to the extent\\n(only) of such invalidity or unenforceability. All other provisions will\\nremain in full effect and, to the extent possible, the invalid or\\nunenforceable provision will be deemed replaced by a provision that is valid\\nand enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such\\ninvalid or unenforceable provision.  \\nCountry-Specific Legal Notices: I have read the country-specific legal\\nnotices below that pertain to my place of employment and/or residence (and\\nalso the location of my employer, if different), if any, and understand that\\nthey apply throughout the term of my Award(s).  \\n[NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION RESTRICTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES PROVIDING\\nIn addition to and without limiting any provisions in the SIP or the\\napplicable Award Agreement(s) (including without limitation the Award vesting,\\ndelivery, forfeiture, termination or repayment provisions) unless provided\\notherwise in the Restrictions, if I am providing services to the Firm in Asia\\nor to BGH, in view of my importance to the Firm and/or BGH, I hereby agree to\\n(a) I hereby agree that the Firm or BGH would likely suffer significant harm\\nif I associate with a Covered Enterprise during my employment and for some\\nperiod of time after my employment ends.

In the\\nevent that I violate any of the Restrictions, I acknowledge that the\\nRestricted Period shall automatically be extended by the period of time that I\\nwas in violation of the said Restriction(s).
